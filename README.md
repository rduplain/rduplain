GitHub's [timeline][timeline] has history back to 2008. Production projects since 2022 are privately hosted elsewhere. Easter eggs throughout, including:

* [an instrument controller][guppi] embedded in a Python REPL w/tab completion of memory locations
* the BSP/community patches that I fixed to run [a custom Linux][linux] on the [PineNote e-reader][pinenote]
* a [personal X11 patch][yeahconsole] that found its own way into [an Arch package][arch]
* the 15-year-old gists that [get traffic][mssql] and are [still marked as helpful][matplotlib] today
* and that one time I got [a hand-written thank-you](img/elasticsearch.jpg) for [a one-line patch][elasticsearch] to elasticsearch. ðŸ¤£

Oh, and I was [an early Flask contributor][flask] and got [commit access to CPython][cpython] back when it was on subversion.
